# VueJS Kanban Board

This is the companion code repository for a forthcoming [Auth0](https://auth0.com) blog article, extending [Vue.js Kanban Board: The Development Process](https://auth0.com/blog/vuejs-kanban-board-the-development-process), adding offline features and data storage capabilities.

Some screenshots of the original application that you will build:
